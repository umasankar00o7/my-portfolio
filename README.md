# Uma Sankar K - Dynamic Portfolio & Learning Journey

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This isn't just a static page; it's a dynamic, interactive digital space I've built from the ground up to chronicle my skills, projects, and my ongoing journey into the world of AI and Data Science.

## 💡 Core Concept

This project is more than a simple showcase. I designed it as a **Portfolio Ecosystem** with three key goals:

1.  **To Impress:** A visually appealing and modern front-end that demonstrates proficiency in UI/UX, animations, and responsive design.
2.  **To Engage:** Real-time, interactive features powered by a backend (Firebase) to create a memorable experience for visitors.
3.  **To Document:** A living, breathing log of my learning progress, managed through a custom-built admin interface, proving my commitment to continuous growth.

## ✨ Key Features

This portfolio is packed with features that demonstrate a wide range of my full-stack development abilities:

*   #### Dynamic & Interactive UI
    *   **Interactive Mouse-Follower:** A subtle spotlight effect on cards that follows the user's cursor.
    *   **Smooth Animations:** Built with AOS.js for elegant scroll-triggered animations.
    *   **Responsive Modals:** Detailed project and certification views that are fully responsive and user-friendly.
    *   **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** A persistent theme preference saved in the user's browser.

*   #### 🧠 AI & Data Science Learning Roadmap
    *   **The Star Feature!** A dedicated page that visualizes my post-graduate journey at IIT Roorkee.
    *   **Timeline Interface:** Presents my weekly learning logs in a beautiful, easy-to-follow timeline.
    *   **Custom Admin Panel:** The entire roadmap is managed through a password-protected admin interface, allowing me to add, edit, and delete entries in real-time.
    *   **Backend Powered:** All roadmap data is stored and retrieved from **Firebase Firestore**, showcasing my ability to work with NoSQL databases.

*   #### 📊 Real-time Engagement Tracking
    *   **Visitor & Share Counts:** Live tracking of page views and shares, stored and updated via Firebase.
    *   **Kudos & Feedback System:** A "quick feedback" system where visitors can leave impressions, with the latest kudos displayed dynamically.
    *   **Telegram Notifications:** A bot integration sends me a real-time Telegram message whenever a new visitor or message arrives.

*   #### 🎮 Collection of Mini-Games & Projects
    *   A curated selection of games like **Hand Cricket**, **Snake Game**, and **Tic-Tac-Toe**, demonstrating core JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.
    *   Practical projects like a **Code Archive** and **Learning Journal**, both powered by Firebase.

## 📂 Project Structure

A brief overview of the key files in this repository:

-   `index.html`: The main portfolio landing page.
-   `currentPG.html`: The public-facing viewer for the AI & Data Science learning roadmap.
-   `admin.html`: The password-protected admin panel for managing roadmap entries.
-   `/games/`: Folder containing the various mini-games.
-   `/journal/`: Folder containing the 100 Days of Code learning journal.
-   `feedback.js`: Handles the logic for the "Kudos" feedback system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate into the project directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

> **Note:** The features powered by Firebase (like the roadmap and feedback stats) will work instantly as the configuration is client-side.

## 🔐 About the Admin Panel

The AI Learning Roadmap is fully dynamic and can be updated without touching the code.

1.  Navigate to `admin.html` in your browser.
2.  You will be prompted for a password.
3.  The password is hard-coded in `admin.html` for this project's demonstration purposes: **xxxx_journey_2024**.
4.  Once logged in, you can add new weekly entries, edit existing ones, or delete them. All changes are saved directly to Firebase and will reflect on the live `currentPG.html` page immediately.
